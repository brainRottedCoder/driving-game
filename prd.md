## 1. Executive Summary

**DriveWise** is a comprehensive, gamified driving education platform that transforms traditional traffic rule learning into an immersive 3D driving experience. Built on the foundation of an existing Unity WebGL traffic simulation, this project aims to be the **one-stop solution for traffic and road safety education**.

### Vision Statement
> "Making every learner a responsible driver through immersive, consequence-based learning"

### Core Philosophy
> **From "Fear of Fines" to "Pride in Skill and Harmony"**
> 
> DriveWise distinguishes between **Rules** (Legal compliance) and **Ethics** (The Social Contract/Empathy). We don't just teach how to avoid tickets—we cultivate drivers who make their communities proud to share the roads with them.

### Key Differentiators
| Traditional Learning | DriveWise |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Memorizing rule books | Learning through experience |
| Theory tests only | Interactive simulation |
| No real consequences | Realistic consequence system |

### Module 10: The Social Contract - Driving Ethics

> [!NOTE]
> **The Ethics Engine Philosophy**
> 
> While laws define the **minimum** acceptable behavior, **ethics defines excellence**. This module implements a parallel "Karma System" that tracks the invisible social contract between road users—the empathy, consideration, and harmony that transform chaotic streets into shared spaces.

#### 10.1 Rules vs Ethics: The Dual Reality

| Scenario | Legal Status | Ethical Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Splashing pedestrian with puddle | ✅ Legal | ❌ Ethical Failure (-100 Karma) |
| Not dipping high beams | ✅ Legal in most cases | ❌ Causes distress (-30 Karma) |
| Refusing to zipper merge | ✅ Legal | ❌ Creates traffic chaos (-40 Karma) |
| Honking at slow e-rickshaw | ✅ Legal | ❌ Stresses vulnerable users (-15 Karma) |
| Using car to shield crossing pedestrian | ➖ Neutral | ✅ Heroic act (+75 Karma) |

**Key Insight**: You can score 100% on traffic rules and still be a *Toxic Driver* in terms of social impact.

---

#### 10.2 The Karma System

**Two Parallel Scores**:
1. **Rule Points** (0-1000): Traditional traffic compliance
2. **Karma Level** (0-1000): Social friction and empathy

**Karma States & Environmental Response**:

| Karma Range | State | Visual | Audio | NPC Behavior |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **750-1000** | 🌟 Zen Mode | Golden lighting, vibrant colors | Lo-fi music, bird sounds | Smiles, waves, grateful gestures |
| **400-749** | 😐 Neutral | Normal colors | Standard traffic hum | Normal interactions |
| **150-399** | 😰 Stressed | Desaturated, harsh reds | Aggressive horns, tense music | Anxious, hurried movements |
| **0-149** | 💀 Toxic | Gray, gloomy tones | Shouting, anger, chaos | Angry gestures, road rage |

**The World Judges You**: Your Karma level literally changes how the game looks, sounds, and responds to you.

#### 10.3 Indian Road Context: The Shared Ecosystem

DriveWise is set in **Urban/Semi-Urban India**, where "road users" include far more than just cars:

##### Vulnerable Road Users
- **E-rickshaws**: Slow, unstable, often driven by elderly
- **Street Vendors**: Pushcarts on roadside, sudden stops
- **Two-wheelers in Rain**: Especially vulnerable to puddle splashes
- **Handcart Pullers**: Human-powered vehicles
- **School Children**: Often crossing without signals

##### Non-Vehicle Entities
- **Cattle**: Free-roaming cows, buffaloes
- **Stray Animals**: Dogs sleeping on roads, crossing unpredictably
- **Processions**: Weddings (baraats), funerals, religious events
- **Temporary Obstacles**: Vendor stalls, parked trucks unloading

##### Infrastructure Challenges
- **Potholes**: Sudden hazards, especially dangerous for two-wheelers
- **Unlit Roads**: Many areas lack streetlights
- **Mixed Traffic**: Cars, bikes, cycles, animals sharing space
- **Unmarked Crossings**: Pedestrians cross anywhere

**Ethics Challenge**: Can you navigate this *organized chaos* with **harmony** rather than **aggression**?

#### 10.5 Empathy Trigger Zones: The Technical Magic

**How It Works**:
Every pedestrian, cyclist, animal, and vulnerable user has an **invisible detection zone**:

| Zone Level | Radius | Safe Speed | Detection |
|------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | 2-5m | 5-10 km/h | Immediate danger zone |
| **Caution** | 5-15m | 15-25 km/h | Early warning |
| **Awareness** | 15-30m | 30-40 km/h | Proactive empathy |

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Karma Impact = (Player Speed - Safe Speed) × Vulnerability Multiplier × Context Factor

Vulnerability Multipliers:
- Children: 2.0x
- Elderly: 1.8x
- Animals: 1.5x
- Two-wheelers in rain: 1.7x
- E-rickshaws: 1.6x

Context Factors:
- Rain: 1.5x (puddle risk)
- Night: 1.2x (visibility)
- School hours: 2.0x
- Near pothole: 1.4x
```

**Example**:
- **Scenario**: Child crossing, you're 4m away at 40 km/h
- **Safe Speed**: 10 km/h (Critical Zone)
- **Calculation**: (40 - 10) × 2.0 (child) × 1.0 = **-60 Karma**
- **Feedback**: Red alert, "DANGER! Child ahead!" + visual slowdown reminder

---

### 5.5 Environment Design

#### City Zones
1. **Training Ground**: Empty area for basics
2. **Residential Area**: Low speed, many stops, pedestrians
3. **School Zone**: Children, strict speed limits
4. **Downtown**: Heavy traffic, complex intersections
5. **Commercial District**: Truck traffic, parking challenges
6. **Highway Interchange**: Merging, high speeds
7. **Rural Roads**: Curves, animals, limited visibility
8. **Industrial Area**: Heavy vehicles, railroad crossings

#### Dynamic Elements
- Day/Night cycle with automatic headlight reminders
- Weather system (sunny → cloudy → rain → storm)
- Traffic density variation (morning rush, evening rush, off-peak)
- Random events (emergency vehicles, accidents, construction)
- Seasonal variations (leaves, snow, ice)

### 5.6 Ethics Engine Architecture

> [!NOTE]
> **Technical Implementation of the Social Contract**
> 
> The Ethics Engine is the game's "moral consciousness"—a parallel processing system that evaluates not just *what* you did (rules) but *how* and *why* you did it (ethics).

#### Core Systems

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Player Action] --> B[EthicsManager]
    B --> C[Rule Points Engine]
    B --> D[Karma Calculator]
    D --> E[Empathy Trigger Zones]

    I --> K[Audio Transformation]
    I --> L[NPC Empathy AI]
    B --> M[Impact Tracker]
    M --> N[Post-Trip Report]
```

#### 1. EthicsManager.cs - Central Controller

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintain dual scoring (Rule Points + Karma Level)
- Track current Karma state (Zen/Neutral/Stressed/Toxic)
- Record ethics timeline for post-trip analysis
- Calculate "Lives Impacted" metrics

**Data Structures**:
```javascript
{
  rulePoints: 850,          // 0-1000
  karmaLevel: 680,          // 0-1000
  karmaState: "Neutral",    // Zen/Neutral/Stressed/Toxic
  livesPositivelyImpacted: 12,
  livesNegativelyImpacted: 3,
  ethicsTimeline: [
    { timestamp: "03:22", event: "Human Shield", karma: +75 },
    { timestamp: "05:18", event: "Splash Zone (careful)", karma: +20 },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Empathy Trigger Zones - The Detection System

**How They Work**:

Every NPC (pedestrian, cyclist, vendor, animal) has **3 concentric detection zones**:

| Zone | Radius | Function | Karma Calculation |
|------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Awareness** | 15-30m | Early detection | Rewards proactive slowing (+3 to +10) |
| **Caution** | 5-15m | Speed assessment | Penalties for unsafe speed (-5 to -30) |
| **Critical** | 2-5m | Immediate danger | High stakes (-60 to +20) |

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Karma Impact = BASE_KARMA × Vulnerability_Multiplier × Context_Factor

Where:
BASE_KARMA = (Player_Speed - Safe_Speed_For_Zone) × -10

Vulnerability Multipliers:
- Children: 2.0x
- Elderly: 1.8x
- Two-wheelers in rain: 1.7x
- E-rickshaws: 1.6x
- Animals: 1.5x
- Vendors with cart: 1.4x

Context Factors:
- Rain/Puddle nearby: 1.5x
- Night/Poor visibility: 1.2x
- School hours (7-9am, 2-4pm): 2.0x
- Near pothole: 1.4x
- Residential area at night: 1.3x
```

**Example Scenarios**:

*Scenario 1: Child Crossing (Critical Zone)*
- Distance: 4m
- Player Speed: 40 km/h
- Safe Speed: 10 km/h
- Calculation: (40-10) × -10 × 2.0 (child) × 1.0 = **-600 Karma**
- Feedback: 🚨 **RED ALERT**: "DANGER! Child ahead!"

*Scenario 2: Cyclist Pass (Caution Zone)*
- Distance: 8m (lateral)
- Player Speed: 45 km/h
- Cyclist Buffer: 1.5m maintained
- Calculation: +15 Karma
- Feedback: 💚 **GREEN GLOW**: "Safe cyclist buffer! +15"

#### 3. Environment Vibe Controller - The World Reacts

**State Transitions**:

| From State → To State | Trigger | Transition Effect |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Neutral → Zen | Karma reaches 750 | 2-second golden fade-in, music crossfade |
| Zen → Neutral | Karma drops below 700 | Gradual color desaturation (5 seconds) |
| Neutral → Stressed | Karma drops below 400 | Color shift to grays, audio tension increase |
| Stressed → Toxic | Karma drops below 150 | Immediate harsh reds, shouting audio layer |

**Visual Parameters by State**:

**Zen Mode**:
```javascript
{
  colorTemperature: +15,      // Warm golden
  saturation: +10,            // Vibrant colors
  lightIntensity: 1.2,        // Bright
  lightColor: #FFF2CC,        // Golden hour
  particleEffects: "floating_sparkles",
  vehicleGlow: "soft_gold"
}
```

**Stress Mode**:
```javascript
{
  colorTemperature: -10,      // Cold blue-gray
  saturation: -20,            // Desaturated
  lightIntensity: 0.8,        // Dim
  lightColor: #999999,        // Gray
  particleEffects: "dust_smoke",
  screenShake: "subtle_jitter"
}
```

**Audio Parameters by State**:

**Zen**: Lo-fi beats (60-80 BPM), bird chirps, light traffic hum (30% volume)
**Stressed**: Tense electronic (100-120 BPM), aggressive honking (70% volume), muffled shouting

#### 4. NPC Empathy AI - Living Reactions

NPCs adjust behavior based on player's Karma state:

| Player Karma | Pedestrian Behavior | Driver Behavior | Timeline |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Zen** | Smile, wave, relaxed crossing | Yield easily, patient | NPCs "feel safe" around you |
| **Neutral** | Normal walking pace | Normal driving | Standard interactions |
| **Stressed** | Hurried, cautious, check both ways | Aggressive, honking | NPCs "sense tension" |
| **Toxic** | Running, fear gestures | Road rage, blocking | NPCs "avoid you" actively |

**Implementation Example**:
```javascript
// Pedestrian sees player approaching
if (playerKarmaState === "Zen") {
  pedestrian.playAnimation("wave");
  pedestrian.walkSpeed = 1.0;  // Normal, relaxed
} else if (playerKarmaState === "Toxic") {
  pedestrian.playAnimation("run");
  pedestrian.walkSpeed = 2.5;  // Panicked running
  pedestrian.lookAtPlayer(anxious: true);
}
```

#### 5. Impact Tracking System

**"Lives Impacted" Calculation**:

Each ethical action/violation affects the counter:

**Positive Impacts**:
- Pedestrian safely yielded to: +1
- Cyclist given safe buffer: +1
- Two-wheeler warned of pothole: +1
- Vendor respected (no horn): +1
- Animal safely navigated: +1
- Breakdown assist: +5 (major help)

**Negative Impacts**:
- Pedestrian splashed: +1 negative
- Driver blinded by high beams: +1 negative
- Cyclist endangered (close pass): +1 negative
- Vendor stressed by honking: +0.5 negative

**The Magic Number**: Game aims for player to end session with **15+ positive impacts** and **<3 negative impacts**
