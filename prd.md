# 🚗 DriveWise: Complete Traffic Ethics & Rules Learning Game

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**DriveWise** is a comprehensive, gamified driving education platform that transforms traditional traffic rule learning into an immersive 3D driving experience. Built on the foundation of an existing Unity WebGL traffic simulation, this project aims to be the **one-stop solution for traffic and road safety education**.

### Vision Statement
> "Making every learner a responsible driver through immersive, consequence-based learning"

### Key Differentiators
| Traditional Learning | DriveWise |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Memorizing rule books | Learning through experience |
| Theory tests only | Interactive simulation |
| No real consequences | Realistic consequence system |
| Boring lectures | Gamified progression |
| One-time learning | Continuous skill building |

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Traffic Education
1. **High accident rates** among new drivers due to theoretical-only training
2. **Poor retention** of traffic rules learned through textbooks
3. **No safe environment** to practice real-world scenarios
4. **Lack of consequence awareness** - learners don't experience "what if"
5. **Expensive driving simulators** are inaccessible to most learners
6. **Inconsistent teaching** across driving schools

### Our Solution
A browser-accessible, gamified driving simulation that covers **every major traffic rule and road safety concept** through hands-on learning.
